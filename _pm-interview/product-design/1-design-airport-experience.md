# Design airport experience

## 1. Clarifying questions to ask the Interviewer 
Before diving into the solution, clarify the scope:
- What do you mean by "airport experience"?
  - (Interviewer: Interpret yourself.)
  - Airport experience covers the journey from arriving at the source airport to leaving the destination airport.
- Why does Google want to build this?
  - (Interviewer: Interpret yourself.)
  - Google's mission is to simplify the world's information and make it accessible & useful.
  - Google already offers multiple travel-related products that can enhance the airport experience.

## 2. Google's mission & existing product fit 
- Google aims to simplify & organize information, making it accessible & useful.
- Google's product suite already plays a role in enhancing the airport experience:
  - Google Maps 🗺️ – Identifying key landmarks (restrooms, lounges, cafeterias).
  - Google Pay 💳 – Enabling seamless payments at duty-free shops, cafes, transport.
  - Google Travel 🛫 – Providing real-time flight status, boarding gate info, luggage drop-off gates.

## 3. Additional clarifying questions 
- Will this be a global or localized product? 
- What is Google's incentive for building this? (Revenue, adoption, branding?) 
- Should this be a standalone app or integrated into existing Google products (Maps, Pay, Travel)? 📲
- How does Google plan to handle partnerships with airlines and airports? 
- What are the privacy & compliance concerns for tracking, biometrics, and payment integration? 

## 4. User personas 
- Business Travellers – Frequent flyers, need quick access to VIP lounges, fast WiFi.
- Solo Travellers – Time-conscious, prefer efficient navigation & quick updates.
- First-time Travellers – Need assistance in check-in, security, immigration, and boarding.
- Family Travellers – Prioritize comfort, restrooms, feeding rooms, and seating.
- Elderly Travellers – Need assistance, minimal walking, and speedier processing.
- Disabled Travellers  – Require guided navigation, wheelchair assistance, and speedier processing.

## 5. User persona prioritization 🔝
- Business & Solo Travelers – Frequent flyers, need less assistance but demand efficiency. (prioritised based on frequency)
- Families, Elderly & Disabled – Require assisted guidance & faster services.

## 6. Key user pain points 
- 🚶 Long Queues – High wait times at check-in, immigration, security & baggage collection.
- Navigation Issues – Large airports can be overwhelming, especially for first-time travelers.
- Missed Updates – Hard to track gate changes, delays, and boarding announcements.
- Anxiety & Stress – Language barriers, immigration, and baggage collection create uncertainty.
- Limited Shopping Avenues – Lack of guidance on duty-free areas, cafeterias, and shopping options.

## Areas to Improve & deep dive 
### 1️⃣ Clarifying questions – Add business & technical depth
Beyond "What do you mean by airport experience?", also ask:
- What is Google's business goal? (E.g., monetization via Google Pay, adoption of Maps, brand reinforcement)
- What data does Google have access to today? (Airlines, airports, existing Google Travel integrations)
- Are we optimizing for all airports or only major hubs initially? (Market segmentation)
- Are we targeting B2C (travelers) or B2B (airports, airlines, vendors)?

### 2️⃣ Competitive landscape & differentiation 
- Who are we competing with?
  - Apple Maps, TripIt, airlines' own apps, airport apps (like Heathrow's).
- How do we differentiate? (Better real-time navigation, predictive AI, deep Google Pay integration).
- Should we partner or compete with existing players? (E.g., should we power airline apps instead of launching our own?)

### 3️⃣ Always add moonshot idea as a Googler 
**Fully Automated Travel Experience:**
- Facial recognition for check-in, security, and boarding (passport-free experience).
- Smart AI-driven airport assistance (personalized real-time recommendations).
- AR-powered navigation using Google Lens (real-time path guidance).
- Drone-based baggage transport within the airport.

### 4️⃣ Add GTM strategy & MVP stages
**Phase 1 (MVP):**
- Integrate navigation & real-time queue updates into Google Maps.
- Enable check-in reminders & flight updates via Google Travel.
- Partner with select airports for queue insights.

**Phase 2:**
- Expand biometric-based check-in & baggage tracking.
- Integrate lounge booking & duty-free shopping into Google Pay.

**Phase 3:**
- Introduce AI-driven personalized recommendations.
- Develop an airport-exclusive standalone app if adoption scales.

**Prioritization framework 🔝**
Prioritize Features with a Framework like ICE (Impact, Confidence, Effort):
- High Impact, Low Effort (MVP) → Queue time prediction, Indoor navigation, Gate updates.
- High Impact, High Effort (Phase 2) → Biometric check-in, RFID baggage tracking.
- Low Impact, High Effort (Deprioritize) → Audio guides (already covered via Google Translate).

### 5️⃣ Monetization & business Impact 
How does Google benefit financially from this? Possible models:
- Google Pay Commissions – Revenue from duty-free, lounges, airport taxis.
- Ads & Partnerships – Featured restaurants, lounges in Google Travel.
- Enterprise Offering – Selling queue management & navigation tools to airports.

### 6️⃣ Success metrics – More actionable 
- Adoption → % of travelers using at least 1 feature (navigation, Pay, queue insights).
- Efficiency Gains → Avg. reduction in check-in & security wait times.
- Monetization → Google Pay transaction volume growth at airports.

## Final refinements 
Make it more Google-like: Google favors scalable, AI-driven, data-centric solutions.
- Add an AI-based personalization layer – Recommends best airport routes, shops, food based on past behavior.
- Leverage Google Assistant – Ask "Where's my gate?" via voice.

Deeper Trade-offs:
- Why NOT a standalone app? – Limited visibility vs. Google Maps' 1B+ users.
- Why NOT just improve Google Travel? – Different core use case (booking vs. real-time assistance).
