# Youtube watch time has gone down. Why?

### üß≠ Clarifying Questions Before Jumping to Solutions
Before analyzing the drop in YouTube watch time, I'd want to clarify a few things:

**Scope of Watch Time Drop**
- Is the decline sudden or gradual?
- Is it a global pattern or localized to certain regions?

**Segmentation**
- Is the drop isolated to specific user segments (e.g., mobile-only users, iOS vs Android, logged-in vs anonymous)?
- Is the drop consistent across content categories (music, gaming, shorts)?

**Success Criteria Predefined?**
- What were the launch success and guardrail metrics?
- Was any acceptable threshold for watch time drop (e.g., ‚â§5%) defined?

**Comment Engagement Definition**
- Does engagement include comment creation, likes, replies, or time spent scrolling comments?

**Quality Control**
- Were there any spam or abuse detection systems enabled during launch?
- Any reported degradation in content quality or recommendations?

These help define whether this is a UX issue, a platform bug, or a deeper product tradeoff.

### üß© Hypothesis Framework for Root Cause
After confirming the above, here's a structured breakdown of possible causes for ‚Üë comment engagement but ‚Üì watch time:

**1. UI Trade-off on Mobile Real Estate**
- On desktop, comments and recommended videos co-exist visibly.
- On mobile, if comments now appear above recommendations, they may push recommendations below the fold, leading to reduced discovery and click-through.

**2. Attention Budget Shift**
- User time is finite. If comments now capture that time (e.g., reading replies), they might spend less time watching a second or third video in the same session.

**3. User Education Gap**
- Users may not realize there are recommended videos below the comments section.
- Especially first-time users of the new UI might think the video ends with the comments.

**4. Poor Recommendation Visibility or Quality**
- Recommendations may not just be lower in the feed but might be less engaging or contextually relevant post-launch.
- Algorithm bugs or exposure changes could reduce CTR and watch time.

**5. Platform-Specific UX Issues**
- The impact could be stronger on iOS vs Android based on gesture patterns, screen sizes, or navigation flows.

**6. Abuse or Spam Boosting Comment Metrics**
- Engagement ‚â† value. If the increase is due to bots or spammy comments, the quality of experience suffers, possibly pushing users away.

### üî¨ Diagnostic Analysis
Assuming comment engagement is valid and meaningful, and there are no major spam issues or platform bugs, I'd narrow focus to:

**Watch Time Funnel Drop-off Analysis**
- Is the drop primarily post-first video?
- Are users still watching one video per session but dropping off instead of continuing?

**Heatmaps and Scroll Behavior**
- Are users reaching the recommendation shelf after viewing comments?
- Is time-on-comments cannibalizing time-on-content?

**Rec System Health Check**
- Are recs being shown, clicked, and watched as before?
- Are CTR and satisfaction metrics (like downvotes or "not interested") up?

### üß™ Remedial Experimentation Plan
**A/B Test: Number of Comments Shown**
- Control: 3 comments shown
- Variants: Show 2 or 1 comment before collapse
- Goal: Restore recommendation visibility without killing comment engagement

**A/B Test: Comment Positioning**
- Control: Comments above recs
- Variant: Collapsed by default / toggle-based / recs first
- Goal: Compare relative engagement and watch time trade-offs

**Tooltip Education**
- Introduce subtle nudge (e.g., "Scroll to view recommended videos")
- Measure recovery in recs CTR and downstream video consumption

**Recommendation Ranker Adjustment**
- Surface shorter videos first post-comment section to ease re-engagement
- Optimize for "low-commitment" next actions

### üìà Metrics to Track
- Primary: Watch time per session, session depth (avg. videos per session)
- Secondary: Scroll-through rate to recs, comment dwell time, recs CTR
- Guardrails: Spam reports, video downvotes, session exits from comment page

### ‚úÖ Decision-Making Framework
Use a launch matrix based on these two axes:
- % Change in Comment Engagement
- % Change in Watch Time

Example:
- +50% comments / -4% watch time ‚Üí Launch ‚úÖ
- +50% comments / -10% watch time ‚Üí Investigate + Iterate ‚ùå
- +30% comments / -2% watch time ‚Üí Consider tradeoff ‚öñÔ∏è

Anchor all experiments to original success + guardrail thresholds. Don't move the goalpost post-launch.

### üß† Final Thoughts
This issue stems from a classic UX vs. engagement tradeoff. Product decisions need:
- Strong upfront hypothesis-setting
- Robust segmentation analysis
- Fast UI experimentation loops
- Clear success criteria defined before the launch

In this case, it's less about failure and more about refining the balance between content consumption and engagement ‚Äî optimizing for total time spent on value-added actions, not just raw numbers.
