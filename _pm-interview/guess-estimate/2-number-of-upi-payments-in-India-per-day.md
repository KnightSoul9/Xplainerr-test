# Number of UPI payments in India per day

Let's go! Estimating **number of UPI payments in India per day** is a classic real-world guesstimate.

# 🧱 Two Frameworks for Estimation

## ✅ 1. Top-Down Approach (Based on population behavior)
**Structure:**
1. Total population of India
2. % with access to smartphones/internet
3. % using UPI
4. % who make UPI payments daily
5. Avg number of UPI transactions per daily user
6. Multiply to get total UPI transactions per day

## ✅ 2. Bottom-Up Approach (Based on use-cases)
**Structure:**
1. Break down by transaction categories:
   * P2P (peer-to-peer)
   * P2M (merchant)
   * Utility payments
   * Subscriptions/autopay
2. Estimate # of daily transactions in each category based on behavior
3. Sum up across all

## 🧮 Calculations Using Both Frameworks

### 🔹 Top-Down Approach
**Step 1: Total population**
* India's population ≈ **1.4B**

**Step 2: % with smartphones and internet**
* Let's say ~65% = **910M people**

**Step 3: % using UPI**
* Assume ~75% of internet users have UPI enabled = **680M**

**Step 4: % who make UPI payments daily**
* Assume 20% are daily transacting users = **136M**

**Step 5: Avg transactions per user per day**
* Assume avg = **2.5 transactions per day** (includes groceries, bills, apps, etc.)

**Final Estimate:**
**136M × 2.5 = 340 million UPI transactions per day**

### 🔹 Bottom-Up Approach
Let's break into categories:

| **Use-Case** | **Users (M)** | **Txns/User/Day** | **Total Txns (M)** |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **P2P** | 100 | 1.5 | 150 |
| **P2M (Retail)** | 70 | 2.0 | 140 |
| **Bill pay** | 50 | 0.2 | 10 |
| **Subscriptions** | 30 | 0.1 | 3 |
| **Online (apps)** | 50 | 0.4 | 20 |
| **Others** | — | — | **10** |

**Final Estimate:**
**Total = 150 + 140 + 10 + 3 + 20 + 10 = ~333 million transactions per day**

## ✅ Triangulated Answer: ~335–340 million UPI transactions/day
**🔁 Delta:**
- **Top-down estimate** = 340M
- **Bottom-up estimate** = 333M
- **Δ (delta)** = **7M (~2%)** → **very tight**, strong triangulation ✅

## Additional Information
Fun fact: As per NPCI data (2024), UPI handles **~350M–400M** transactions per day, so we're quite close!
