# Self driving car market size in US

Let's estimate the **Self-Driving Car (Autonomous Vehicle, AV) market size in the U.S.** using two structured approaches and triangulate.
We'll define market size as **annual revenue opportunity** in the U.S. for AVs — including hardware, software, services, and fleet operations.

## 🚗 Two Frameworks for Estimation:

### ✅ 1. Top-Down (Market Penetration of Auto Industry)
**Structure:**
1. U.S. auto market size
2. % of market shifting to AV (Level 4/5)
3. Avg revenue generated per AV/year (including sales + services + AV SaaS stack)

### ✅ 2. Bottom-Up (Use-case-based modeling)
**Structure:**
1. Segment AV use-cases:
  * Robo-taxis
  * Autonomous trucks/delivery
  * Personal ownership
  * Subscriptions/Fleet services
2. Estimate revenue for each segment based on:
  * No. of vehicles
  * Revenue per vehicle per year
3. Sum across segments

## 🔍 Framework 1: Top-Down Estimation
**Step 1: U.S. auto industry size**
* ~$1.5T/year (including car sales, services, financing)

**Step 2: % of vehicles with L4+ autonomy by near-future**
* Let's assume **10% penetration by 2030** (early-stage market today, niche usage) → 10% × $1.5T = **$150B**

**Step 3: Share of revenue AV players can capture (hardware, AV stack, services)**
* Assume AV-specific stack captures ~40% of this ($60B)

**✅ Top-Down Estimate = ~$60 billion/year**

## 🔍 Framework 2: Bottom-Up Use-case Estimation
Let's break it into key categories:

| **Segment** | **Vehicles (M)** | **Revenue/Vehicle/Year** | **Total Revenue** |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Robo-taxis (Waymo, Cruise, etc) | 0.5M | $60,000 | $30B |
| Autonomous trucks/delivery | 0.2M | $150,000 | $30B |
| Personal AV ownership | 0.2M | $25,000 | $5B |
| AV SaaS stack/licenses (B2B) | — | — | ~$5B |

**✅ Bottom-Up Estimate = ~$70 billion/year**

## ✅ Triangulated AV Market Size (U.S.): $60B – $70B annually
**🔁 Delta:**
* Difference = $10B
* Percentage delta ≈ **16%** → Acceptable range for an emerging market

## 📌 Real-World Benchmark:
* McKinsey & Allied Market Research project U.S. AV market size to grow to **$60B–$80B by 2030**
* So we're well within range, possibly conservative!
