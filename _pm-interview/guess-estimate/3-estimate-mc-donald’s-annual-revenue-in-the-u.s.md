# Estimating McDonald's Annual Revenue in the U.S.

## 🧱 Two Frameworks for Estimation

### ✅ Framework 1: Top-Down (Store-based estimation)
**Structure:**
1. Number of McDonald's stores in the U.S.
2. Average revenue/store/day
3. Multiply by number of days in a year

### ✅ Framework 2: Bottom-Up (Customer footfall & ticket size)
**Structure:**
1. Avg number of customers per store per day
2. Average spend per customer
3. Number of stores × customers × ticket size × days

## 🧮 Calculations Using Both Frameworks

### 🔍 Framework 1: Top-Down Approach
**Step 1: Number of McDonald's stores in the U.S.**
* Approx **13,500 stores**

**Step 2: Avg revenue per store per day**
* Assume a busy U.S. McD does ~$7,000–$8,000/day in sales
* Let's take **$7,500/day**

**Step 3: Annual revenue**
= 13,500 stores × $7,500/day × 365 = **$36.9 billion/year**

### 🔍 Framework 2: Bottom-Up Approach
**Step 1: Avg footfall per store per day**
* Assume ~550 customers/day per store

**Step 2: Avg spend per customer**
* Typical ticket size = **$13**

**Step 3: Revenue per store/day**
= 550 × $13 = **$7,150**

**Step 4: Annual revenue**
= 13,500 × $7,150 × 365 = **$35.3 billion/year**

## ✅ Triangulated Answer: $35.3B – $36.9B annual revenue
**🔁 Delta:**
* Difference = ~$1.6B
* Percentage delta ≈ **4.4%** → Pretty tight!

## 📌 Real-world benchmark:
As per McDonald's actual financials, **U.S. systemwide sales** are around **$45B**, but **McDonald's corporate revenue** from U.S. operations (which includes royalties and owned-store revenue) is closer to **$38–40B** — so we're **very close**!
