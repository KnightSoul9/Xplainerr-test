# Improve YouTube 

## ✅ Step 1: Clarifying Questions
Before solving, here's what I'd ask:
- What's the primary goal of the improvement?
  - User retention?
  - Time spent?
  - Monetization (ads, YouTube Premium, Super Chats)?
  - Creator tools & satisfaction?
  - New markets or content formats?
- Which user segment are we focusing on?
  - Viewers? (casual, logged-out, Premium)
  - Creators? (new, mid-size, top creators)
  - Advertisers?
- Are we optimizing for a specific device or geography?
  - Mobile vs. desktop vs. TV?
  - India/Brazil vs. US?
- Do we want to focus on YouTube core, Shorts, or Live?

## 📌 Assumptions (based on a typical PM scenario)
- 🎯 Goal: Increase viewer engagement (session depth + stickiness).
- 👥 Target Segment: Casual mobile viewers globally.
- 📱 Device: Mobile-first, Android-heavy audience.
- 📺 Content type: Focus on YouTube Shorts (strategic bet from YouTube to compete with TikTok/IG Reels).

## 🧠 Step-by-Step PM Interview Solution

### 🎯 Step 2: Define the Product Goal
**Goal**: Increase YouTube Shorts session length and repeat visits, especially from casual scrollers.

**Why?**
- Shorts are a major strategic investment.
- Viewer churn is high if they don't get value fast.
- The monetization model depends on sustained engagement (ads between shorts).

### 👥 Step 3: Define and Prioritize User Segments
**Target Users**:
- New or low-engaged viewers of Shorts.
- Often scroll passively, bounce quickly.
- Get stuck in uninteresting rabbit holes.

### 🔍 Step 4: Key Pain Points
- **Discovery fatigue** – Users see too much random or low-relevance content in early sessions.
- **Lack of continuity or identity** – Viewers don't feel a sense of "ownership" over what they've liked or seen.
- **Passive scrolling = forgettable** – Users don't remember creators or themes they liked → no habit formation.

### 💡 Step 5: Product Vision
"Make YouTube Shorts feel more personal, memorable, and habit-forming—without breaking the simplicity of the infinite scroll."

### 🛠️ Step 6: Proposed Solution — Shorts Smart Stacks
A personalized, interactive overlay in YouTube Shorts that clusters content into snackable stacks, each centered on a theme, creator, or vibe.

#### 🔧 Key Features
1. **Auto-curated Stacks**
   - Group 5–7 Shorts under one category:
     - "Motivation Monday"
     - "Trending Tech Creators"
     - "Soothing Lo-fi Vibes"
   - Preview the stack title before it starts; swipe to move to another stack.

2. **Light Personalization Layer**
   - Uses watch history + emoji feedback ("🔥", "🤷", "👎") to auto-adapt stacks.
   - Example: "Liked 3 Indian comedy Shorts? → Serve 'Top Desi Creators' stack."

3. **Stack Completion Rewards**
   - Micro-rewards: badges, creator follow suggestions, save favorite stack for rewatch.
   - "You unlocked this creator's behind-the-scenes short."

4. **Stack Pins**
   - Save a favorite stack to revisit later or share with friends.
   - Optionally auto-subscribe to creators in that stack.

### 🧑‍💻 Step 7: User Journey Example
- User opens Shorts → sees "Today's Stack: Indie Game Devs 🔥"
- Watches 5 short-form game builds + dev logs.
- After stack: sees "Liked it? Follow top creator + see their next drop tomorrow."
- Taps "🔥" on a short → more creator stacks show up next day.
- Saves the stack to revisit or share → habit loop forms.

### 📊 Step 8: Success Metrics
**North Star**:
- 📈 Avg. Shorts session duration per user

**Supporting Metrics**:
- % of users completing a "stack"
- Stack reaction rate ("🔥" or "🤷")
- Follow rate of creators after stacks
- Return rate after viewing a stack
- Time to first like/follow per session

### ⚖️ Step 9: Trade-offs & Mitigation

| Trade-off | Risk | Mitigation |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Breaks current infinite scroll simplicity | Increased cognitive load | Stack preview UI must be minimal, optional |
| Misclassified stacks frustrate users | Feels repetitive or off | Let users skip stacks quickly and provide emoji feedback |
| Might reduce total Shorts volume seen | Fewer ads | But deeper engagement → better monetization per minute |

## ✅ Summary
To improve YouTube, we focus on viewer engagement in YouTube Shorts. By introducing "Smart Stacks", we personalize the discovery experience, reduce decision fatigue, and encourage deeper, more intentional consumption—driving habit loops, content affinity, and ultimately, monetization.
